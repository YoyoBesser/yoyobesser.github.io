Hello to all the indexing bots reading this! (and the occasional human too)

The time has come for me to justify the domain purchase I made all those months ago....

And have a place to write about all the interesting little problems I run into and feel a need to share. 


So to kick things off, here's a story about a useful Terraform pattern I stumbled upon recently, which I hadn't seen anywhere online before:

# Conditional `dynamic` Blocks in Terraform

## wtf are `dynamic` blocks?

`dynamic` blocks in Terraform are a feature meant to help you **DRY** up (Don't Repeat Yourself) any pesky repeating objects/settings you need to define inside of a resource.

(For a more legible explanation, see the Terraform docs on them [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/dynamic-blocks) )

## The Art of The Chart 

While writing a Terraform module for bootstrapping a Kubernetes cluster, I ran into the Terraform ['helm' provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/helm/2.7.1/docs) (specifically the ['helm_release'](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/helm/2.7.1/docs/resources/release) `resource`)  while looking for ways to provision `argocd`.

To configure the chart you're installing with a `helm_release` resource, you can pass values files with the `values` argument, just like you would to `helm install -f`, but that didn't sit right with me because:
- I hate defining additional files inline in Terraform modules (`jsonencode` and its brethren can f**k off)
- Adding an additional external file didn't seem quite "clean" as well 

So the other option left to me for passing configuration, was using `set` blocks inside the `helm_release`, as shown in the docs:

![from the terraform 'helm_resource docs'](./assets/images/20250512/helm-set.png ){: width="972" height="589" .w-50 }

this method looks somewhat okay? and a much more "Terraform-native" way of doing things.

## But then, a conditional shower thought 
Everything up until here looked fine, I could pass the values I wanted to the chart.

But reading through the docs for the chart, I had a thought....

What if I wanted to place some of the values behind a feature flag? Only setting certain options when a certain variable in my Terraform module is set to `true`?

This led me down the rabbit hole of (drumroll....) conditionals in Terraform!

### We're living in a conditional world, but TF is not a conditional girl  

Turns out that (as of writing this) there's no official "if/else" feature in Terraform :(
Looks like the standard answer in most posts/guides when people ask for a way to conditionalize the creation of whole `resource` blocks is to use a combination of HCL's ternary expressions and Terraform `resource`'s `count` argument like this:

```hcl
'some_resource' 'resource' {
    count = var.create_resource_flag ? 1 : 0
    ......
}
```


If the variable `create_resource_flag` is true the result of the expression will be `1` and Terraform will create `1` instance of it.
If it's false the result will be `0`, and thus `0` resources will be provisioned (A.K.A, nothing).


So my first instinct was "maybe this will work in the `set` block as well":

![pic](./assets/images/20250512/count-err.png ){: width="972" height="589" .w-50 }

A guy can hope, lol. 

Which led me to continue my search, when suddenly I stumbled upon `dynamic` blocks!

I assumed that if I followed the logic of passing `0` to the `count` attribute of a block, maybe I could similarly pass an empty iterable to a dynamic block to have it create nothing? (like passing an empty collection to a Python `for <> in <>` block)

![pic](./assets/images/20250512/tern-err.png ){: width="972" height="589" .w-50 }

But Terraform had different plans... Looks like the parser is not a fan of `map` or `object` types with inconsistent keys on each side 

## And finally....

Luckily all I had to do to remedy the situation was find an iterable that Terraform **would** allow in the ternary, like lists!

![pic](./assets/images/20250512/succ.png ){: width="972" height="589" .w-50 }

Got it! The list passes on to the `for_each` argument, and I can get the values by "looking them up" in the original map.
The `set` blocks are only created when `var.feature_flag` is set to `true`!

Here's the entirety of the little mock `main.tf` I used to play around with this idea, if you want to try it out yourself:

```hcl
variable "feature_flag" {
  type    = bool
  default = true
}

locals {
  argocd_ha_chart_values = {
    "redis.ha.enabled"                    = true,
    "controller.enableStatefulSet"       = true,
    "server.autoscaling.enabled"         = true,
    "server.autoscaling.minReplicas"     = 2,
    "repoServer.autoscaling.enabled"     = true,
    "repoServer.autoscaling.minReplicas" = 2
  }
}

resource "helm_release" "argocd" {
  name             = "argocd"
  repository       = "https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm"
  chart            = "argo-cd"


  dynamic "set" {
    for_each = var.feature_flag ? tolist(keys(local.argocd_ha_chart_values)) : []
    content {
      name  = set.value
      value = local.argocd_ha_chart_values[set.value]
    }
  }
}

```
