Hello to all the indexing bots reading this! (and the occasional human too)

The time has come for me to justify the domain purchase I made all those months ago....

And have a place to write about all the interesting little problems I run into and feel a need to share. 


So here we go with #1:

# Conditional `dynamic` Blocks in Terraform

## wtf are `dynamic` blocks?

`dynamic` blocks in Terraform are a feature meant to help you **DRY** up (Don't Repeat Yourself) any pesky repeating objects/settings you need to define inside of a resource.

(For a more legible explanation, see the Terraform docs on them [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/dynamic-blocks)

## In the wild

While writing a Terraform module for bootstrapping a Kubernetes cluster, I ran into the Terraform ['helm' provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/helm/2.1.2/docs/resources/release) for the first time. (specifically for provisioning `argocd` in my case) 



If you want to mess with the values passed to a chart when using the `helm_release` resource, you can pass a normal values file like you would to `helm install -f`, but I wasn't really feeling like that was a choice because:
- I hate defining additional files inline in Terraform modules (`jsonencode` and it's brethren can f**k off)
- And adding an additional external file didn't seem quite "clean" as well 

So the other option left to me, was using `set` blocks inside the `helm_release`, like they show in their docs:

![from the terraform 'helm_resource docs'](./assets/images/20250512/helm-set.png ){: width="972" height="589" .w-50 }

this method looks kinda okay-ish? and a much more "Terraform" way of doing things.

## But then, a conditional shower thought 
So all looks fine, I can pass the values I want to pass to the chart.

But reading through the docs for the chart, I had a thought. 

What if I wanted to place some of the values behind a feature flag? Only setting certain options when a certain variable in my Terraform module is set to `true`?

This led me down the rabbit hole of conditional-anything in Terraform. 

### We're living in a conditional world, but TF is not a conditional girl  

Turns out that (as of writing this) there's no official "if/else" feature in Terraform, I discovered the standard answer in most posts/guides for conditionalizing the creation of whole `resource` blocks is to use a combination of HCL's ternary expressions and Terraform's `count` attribute like this:
```hcl
'some_resource' 'foobar' {
    count = var.create_foobar_flag ? 1 : 0
    ......
}
```

If the variable `create_foobar_flag` is true the result of the expression will be `1` and Terraform will create `1` instance of it.
If it's false the result will be `0` and thus `0` resources will be provisioned (A.K.A, nothing).


So my first instinct was "maybe this will work in the `set` block as well":

![pic](./assets/images/20250512/count-err.png ){: width="972" height="589" .w-50 }

A guy can hope, lol. 

Which led me to continue my search, when suddenly I stumbled into `dynamic` blocks!

I assumed that if I follow the logic of passing `0` to the `count` attribute of a block, maybe I can similarly pass an empty iterable to a dynamic block to have it create nothing?

![pic](./assets/images/20250512/tern-err.png ){: width="972" height="589" .w-50 }

But Terraform had different plans... Looks like the parser is not a fan of `map` or `object` types with inconsistent keys on each side 

## And finally....

Luckily all I had to do to remedy the situation was find an iterable that Terraform would allow in the ternary

![pic](./assets/images/20250512/succ.png ){: width="972" height="589" .w-50 }

Got it! the `set` blocks are only created when `var.feature_flag` is set to `true`!

Here's the entirety of this little mock `main.tf` I used to play around with this idea, if you want to try it out yourself:

```HCL
variable "feature_flag" {
  type    = bool
  default = true
}

locals {
  argocd_ha_chart_values = {
    "redis.ha.enabled"                    = true,
    "controller.enableStatefulSet"       = true,
    "server.autoscaling.enabled"         = true,
    "server.autoscaling.minReplicas"     = 2,
    "repoServer.autoscaling.enabled"     = true,
    "repoServer.autoscaling.minReplicas" = 2
  }
}

resource "helm_release" "argocd" {
  name             = "argocd"
  repository       = "https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm"
  chart            = "argo-cd"


  dynamic "set" {
    for_each = var.feature_flag ? tolist(keys(local.argocd_ha_chart_values)) : []
    content {
      name  = set.value
      value = local.argocd_ha_chart_values[set.value]
    }
  }
}


```
